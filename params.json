It is an example of a complementary monetary system. A time bank, also known as a service exchange, is a community that practices time banking. The unit of currency, always valued at an hour's worth of any person's labor, used by these groups has various names, but is generally known as a time dollar in the USA and a time credit in the UK. Time banking is primarily used to provide incentives and rewards for work such as mentoring children, caring for the elderly, being neighborly—work usually done on a volunteer basis—which a pure market system devalues. Essentially, the \"time\" one spends providing these types of community services earns \"time\" that one can spend to receive services.\r\n\r\n\r\n[^1]: (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_banking)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_banking]\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nContributors of the organization are\r\n@dainiusjocas\r\nAnd the others..\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nInterested?
